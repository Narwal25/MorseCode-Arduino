## Project Overview

This Arduino project encodes and decodes messages using BCCode, visually transmitting them through LEDs, and responding to specific commands.

## Project Features

### Encoding and Decoding

Transforms ASCII text into BCCode with precise spacing rules, ensuring optimal representation.

### LED Transmission

Visual representation of messages through LEDs, with user-controlled transmission speed using a potentiometer.

### Command Handling

Four distinct commands are integrated:
- **BxB Command:** Transmit potentiometer value as BCCode.
- **PB Command:** Interpret three decimal digits, determining IR sensor input.
- **BC Command:** Alter brightness of the red LED based on decimal digits.
- **BB Command:** Orchestrate synchronous flashes of LEDs based on specific time units.

## Challenges Addressed

### Spacing Complexity

Robust algorithms manage spacing intricacies within BCCode, ensuring precise rules during encoding and decoding.

### Precise Timing

Utilization of the millis() function facilitates precise control over LED on and off intervals, ensuring accurate and synchronized visual representations.

### Command Interpretation

Dedicated functions handle each command appropriately, ensuring accurate and responsive execution.
